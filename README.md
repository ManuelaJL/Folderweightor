# Folder weightor #

I made this tool to analyze folders so I know which subfolders are using up the most space on my hard disc. <br>
Just run Folderscale.java.<br>
One little bug: after the folder has been successfully analyzed (when the output says "done drawing") you have to resize the window for the graph to become visible.
